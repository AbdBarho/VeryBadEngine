[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AbdBarho/VeryBadEngine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AbdBarho/VeryBadEngine)

My first attempt at creating a game engine.

A preview of the current engine capabilities [can be found here](https://abdbarho.github.io/VeryBadEngine/)


## Todo:
- ~~move main loop to a worker~~ forget about workers for now
- use WebGl instead of 2D
- use bigint to mark entities with flags, later use only these flags in the fetch the updatable entities
- ~~proper implementation of speed and acceleration limiting~~ (find more efficient solution)
- improve logger and debugging tools
- ~~remove functions from Vec2 class, make solely a data object~~
- work on level switching and think about the life cycles of each level and its systems
- ...
